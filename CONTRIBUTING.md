## 🧑‍💻 Code Guidelines

When submitting code changes to the PowerShell script, please keep the following in mind:
* **Safety First:** We are dealing with the Windows Registry and system folders. Always use `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` where appropriate so the script doesn't crash if a file is heavily locked, unless a hard fail is absolutely necessary.
* **Keep it Clean:** Follow the existing color-coded `Write-Host` structure:
  * `Cyan` for Main Steps
  * `Yellow` for active tasks or warnings
  * `Green` for success messages
  * `DarkGray` for granular files being deleted
* **Comments:** Although the README is bilingual, it is preferred to keep code comments in Spanish (as it currently is) or bilingual if you are adding new heavy logic.
